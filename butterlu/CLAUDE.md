# Butterlu — agent operating guide

You are working on **Butterlu Gifts**, a personalised picture-frame and keepsake-gift
business. Read this file fully before touching anything. It exists so you do not have to
re-derive what has already been established, and so you do not repeat mistakes that are
expensive here.

## 1. What this business actually is

| | Etsy | butterlu.com |
|---|---|---|
| Reviews | **13,635** (4.9★, Star Seller) | 0 |
| Sales | **75,903** | **0, all time** |
| Listings / products | 635 | 243 (99 live) |

**The successful business is on Etsy. The website is a broken photocopy of it.** Product
descriptions on the .com still open *"Welcome to Boutique ButterLu!"*, images are served
from Etsy's CDN as `il_fullxfull.*`, and ~83 product pages link back to Etsy. Two of the
top five listings on Etsy's `/market/aunt_picture_frame` page (which ranks #1 for
"aunt gift personalized frame") are ButterLu's. The brand already ranks — as `etsy.com`.

## 2. Ground truth — verified, do not re-derive

Established via the Shopify Admin API and ShopifyQL. Trust these:

- **243 products**: 99 active, 15 draft, **129 archived**. Published 99 / unpublished 144.
- **0 orders, all time.** Conversion 0.0% every month on record.
- Store is on the **"Pause and Build" plan, which disables checkout.** Since Apr-2026,
  58 cart additions produced **zero** checkout sessions. Before Apr-2026 they reached
  checkout normally.
- **`urlRedirects` is completely empty.** No 301 has ever been created on this store, so
  all 129 archived products are hard 404s.
- **`seo.title` and `seo.description` are null on all 243 products.** The theme falls back
  to `title | truncate: 70`, so every `<title>` cuts mid-word.
- **Traffic (365d): 20,344 sessions — 20,126 "direct", 75 Google organic**, 68 Pinterest,
  31 Facebook, 24 TikTok. The "direct" mass is crawler traffic walking `?variant=` URLs
  (hundreds of variant URLs each at a near-identical 13–17 sessions). **Real human traffic
  is roughly 200 sessions/year.**
- **Variant split is total**: every top-performing product has **42 variants / 1 option**;
  every underperformer has **exactly 100 / 2 options** (Shopify's per-product cap). Three
  of them need 34×3 = 102 combinations and were truncated to 100, so selectable options
  exist that cannot be purchased.
- **No personalisation input field exists.** The purchase form is Color → Quantity → Add
  to cart, while the copy tells buyers to use Etsy's "note to seller" field. Any order that
  completed would ship un-personalised.
- **Only product metafield in use** is `mc-facebook.google_product_category`. No review
  app, no review metafields.
- Canonicals are correct — no `?variant=` leakage. This one thing is already right.

### Etsy Open API v3 — verified against the live docs
- `GET /v3/application/shops/{shop_id}/reviews` — **`x-api-key` only, no OAuth.**
- Returns: `listing_id`, `transaction_id`, `buyer_user_id`, `rating`, `review`, `language`,
  `image_url_fullxfull`, `create_timestamp`. **No reviewer display name.**
- Rate limits: **150 QPS / 100,000 QPD**. Not a constraint.
- **There is no review webhook.** The complete event list is `order.paid`,
  `order.canceled`, `order.shipped`, `order.delivered`. Available to personal apps,
  HMAC-signed, retried with backoff to ~10h.

## 3. Hard constraints — these will bite you

1. **Bulk edits have no undo.** 243 products. Always dry-run, always write a backup to the
   manifest before overwriting content, always stop at a 10% error rate.
2. **The Shopify connector cannot write to the live theme.** Theme-file writes are
   permitted on **unpublished themes only**. Build on a duplicate; a human publishes.
3. **`appInstallations` is outside the connector's scope** — it returns `access denied`.
   Detect installed apps by their metafield namespaces instead.
4. **Etsy API Terms restrict what you may do with review data.** See
   `docs/06-etsy-tos-constraints.md`. Short version: §9 prohibits screen-scraping Etsy
   *"even if such data is not available in the Etsy API"*, and §1/§4 restrict caching
   Member Content and driving traffic off-platform. **Do not scrape Etsy. Do not build the
   review migration until Etsy answers the pending question.**
5. **Never treat imported Etsy reviews as verified Shopify purchases**, never restamp their
   dates, never map a review onto a product other than the listing it was written about.
6. **Secrets live in the environment, never in this repo.** See `.env.example`. The Etsy
   keystring and shared secret exist but are deliberately not stored here.

## 4. Gate status

| Gate | What | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **G1** | Enable checkout (leave "Pause and Build") | Human | **OPEN** — blocks all revenue |
| **G2** | Consolidation decisions (keep/kill per duplicate cluster) | Human | **OPEN** — needs Wave 0 output first |
| **G3** | Etsy app credentials | Human | **DONE** — keystring + shared secret obtained |
| **G4** | Cloudflare connector authorised | Human | **DONE** |
| **G5** | Etsy's answer on review republishing | Etsy | **OPEN** — email sent to developer@etsy.com |

G1 blocks no other task but nothing earns until it is done. G2 is the hinge — it blocks
both the catalog chain and the review chain.

---

## 5. Where to start

**Wave 0 is ready and unblocked.** Use `prompts/wave-0-kickoff.md` verbatim. It is
read-only apart from one single-product write test, and that test answers the question
everything else depends on: **does the paused plan permit Admin API writes at all?**

Do not start Wave 1 until a human has filled in `plans/decisions.json`.
Do not start Wave 2 or 3 until G5 resolves.

---

## 6. Conventions

**Manifest-driven loops.** Every bulk operation reads its work list from a JSON file in
`plans/` and marks each row `applied: true` as it goes. Nothing lives in agent context.
A dead session resumes by reading the file. Re-running is always safe.

```
for batch in manifest.rows.where(applied == false).chunk(BATCH):
    for row in batch:
        result = mutate(row)               # one API call per item
        assert verify(row)                 # read back, confirm
        row.applied = true                 # checkpoint immediately
        log(run-log.jsonl, row, result)    # append-only audit trail
    persist(manifest)                      # flush before next batch
    if error_rate(batch) > 0.1: HALT       # circuit breaker
```

**A loop never derives its work list at runtime.** It reads a manifest a human or an
earlier step produced, so the plan is auditable before a single mutation fires.

Loops are `L1`–`L8`, gates `G1`–`G5`. Use the same identifiers in manifests, commits and
`run-log.jsonl`.

## 7. Unverified — do not assume either way

- **Whether the "Pause and Build" plan permits Admin API writes.** Wave 0's write test
  settles this. Everything downstream assumes yes.
- **Whether the live theme already emits Product JSON-LD.** If it does, adding review
  markup will collide. The crawler used for the audit strips `<script>` tags, so this was
  never confirmed. Check with Google's Rich Results Test.
- **Backlink profile.** No Ahrefs/Moz access was available. The domain-authority argument
  in `docs/03` is inferred from SERP composition, not measured. Largest single unknown.
- **Keyword volumes.** "Winnable" in `docs/03` reflects competitive difficulty only, not
  traffic value.
- **Orphaned products.** A crawl found ~120 URLs against 99 live products plus collections.
  Wave 0 quantifies this.
- The godparent cluster size (~104) came from a subagent audit, not a first-party count.
  Wave 0 confirms or corrects it.
